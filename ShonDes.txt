About Myself:

My name is Shon Butz. I come from a small town in Colorado that knew mostly about farming and diesel mechanics, so 
being in computer science was a stretch for me when it comes to obtaining knowledge from somewhere. My school didn't teach 
anything in it so I had to be self taught in it. I took a computer science course before coming to CU and learned a little bit
of C++ before my professor quitted. In the past I had also taken self classes on Java, Python, HTML, and SQL. I have been interested
in computer science since I was young and mainly in the field of cyber security. I find it as my calling and I wanna push to gain
more and more knowledge on this subject through my times at CU in the computer sceince course and through peers that are presented
to me and opportunites. 

Goals in this Semester:

I am currently working on a certification towards cyber security under a specific company of IBM that is taking me more time
then I have planned and unfortunately with all the midterms and homework I haven't had much time, but I am hoping during these breaks
we have coming up, I can continue and possibly finish it by the next semester.
